# Summary

The following represents some initial thoughts around objectives, scope, and effort. This is provided to help with high-level budgeting and planning only and does not represent a formal quotation.

To take this proposal forward, we recommend the following two-stage approach:

1. **Planning and design** Statement of Work, including workshops, architectural detailing, and creation of a detailed implementation project plan.
2. **Implementation and go-live** Statement of Work, including development, integration, and User Acceptance Testing, and out into pilot and production.

* Support current reporting output, but enable self-service reporting also.
* Single-sign-on Integration.
* Increase capacity to support "every offering every time".
* Improve support for Mobile devices.
