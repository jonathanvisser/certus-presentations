# Digital Strategy

.left.box.small.red[
* Focus on business value and opportunity
* Under-take portfolio analysis and rationalisation
   * Replace
   * Retire
   * Re-write
   * Re-platform
   * Consolidate
* Re-architect at the enterprise-level
* Re-vamp and stream-line the software deliver process end-to-end

### Cloud strategy
.left.box.small.red[
* Cloud is at the heart of digital strategy
* App modernisation should leverage the best in a sustainable & strategic way
* Beware of defaults and pitfalls
* But optimise for speed and value
* Recognising the difference between Enterprise cloud as XaaS
* Consider managed services for platforms...
* ... enterprise cloud for bespoke or high-need services
* Consider lock-in, but balance that against risk/cost
* Embed security and governance

.left.box.small.green[
#### Bespoke
* Treat bespoke software like a product - like a technology platform ripe with opportunity.
* With bespoke there is fear of risk - but a good partner can lead you through the landmines.
* Consider change management and user adoption strategies and align with software backlog.
