.small[
* **WordPress:** 
	* internet portal
	* web content management
	* integrates with event calendar data
* **AVIARC:**
	* business process/business logic
	* forms/data capture
	* content management
	* reporting
	* user identity and access
* **Postgres:**
	* data storage

# Architectural Goals

* Increase user adoption and satisfation by delivering a superior web and mobile experience.
* Address technical debt whilst leveraging the existing good work and investment.
* Deliver a solution simple to extend and cost-effective to maintain.
* Leverage widely supported and portable technology to ensure long-term viability.

# Solution Scope
Limiting the immediate focus to the Event Registration use case:
.grid.x3[
.left.box.small.green.component[
** STREAMLINED EVENT REGISTRATION **
* Event form
* Payment form
]
.right.box.small.blue.component.tech[
** TECHNOLOGY** <br><br>
* Front-end framework
* Integration strategy
]
.right.box.small.yellow.inverse.questions[
** Questions **
* Any rentals other than transponders?
* Events ask for checking of profile details - include?
* Include up-sell offerings during payment?
* Improve calendar->event reg. (entry point) experience?
* MVP: event registration only?

## Solution Options - UI
.floatleft[Front-end framework]
]
.small[
There are two main options to consider to deliver a smooth and modern user experience for desktop, tablet & mobile. Both move away from pure AVIARC approach; both require bespoke development.
]
.grid.small[.x[
#### WordPress Plugin/Widget
WordPress is a mature, widely used, and open platform with many existing extensions. It is currently being used to server the main website - which is "responsive" (works ok on mobile devices). It can be extended with custom components.
.closer[
###### Pros:
]
* Consolidates all front-end development onto a single platform.
* Seamlessly integrates with existing website.
* Supports CRM and e-commerce extensions.

.closer[
###### Cons:
]
* Originally for blogging.
* There are platform constraints and complexities to overcome.
* Cannot be used to replace Aviarc-embedded business logic.
]
.y[
#### Stand-alone modern bespoke Web App
With a variety of good options to chose from, open, flexible, with rapid development tooling, a bespoke responsive web application provides the best user-experience and future options.
.closer[
###### Pros:
]
* Light-weight, unencumbered, and fit for purpose.
* Opens architecture for improvements and scaling.
* Highly responsive/fast experience.

.closer[
###### Cons:
]
* Additional architectural layer - discrete from either AVIARC or WordPress.

## Solution Options - API
.floatleft[Integration strategy]
]
.small[
Possum contains complex business rules developed over time. This represents a very real challenge. There are distinct ways of dealing with this: wrap & reuse or rebuild clean. There are signficant strategic implications either way.
]
.grid.small[.x[
#### AVIARC API (wrap & reuse)
.closer[
###### Pros:
]
* Can leverage existing components such as databrokers/XMLCommands.
* Single codebase to maintain.
* Hides the complexity and defers dealing with it.

.closer[
###### Cons:
]
* Non-standard industry framework/toolsets that require heavy customisation and not following best practice.
* Hard to replicate full REST capabilities in Aviarc.
* Bound to Aviarc application/platform.
* Hard to test, hard to change.
]
.y[
#### Specialised API (rebuild clean)
.closer[
###### Pros:
]
* Industry standard frameworks/toolsets that are fit for purpose and can develop according to best practice.
* Can run independently of Aviarc application/platform - direct access to DB.
* Robust, secure and proven.
* Easily testable, easy to extend and maintain.

.closer[
###### Cons:
]
* Canâ€™t leverage existing Aviarc components/business logic.
* Another codebase to maintain.
* Likely duplicate code - and potential for inconsistencies.

# Next Steps

### Stage One - Planning and Design

.grid[.left.box.small.blue[ ** ARCHITECTURE & DESIGN **
* Discover workshop to refine requirements.
* Architectural detailing:
  * Integration scoping
  * Business process design
  * Orchestration design
  * Target Platforms review
  * Data architecture ]

.right.box.small.yellow[** PROJECT MANAGEMENT **
* Creation of a detailed implementation project plan:
  * Costings
  * Schedule
  * Resource plan

# The Way Forward

To take this proposal forward, we recommend the following three-stage approach:

1. **Planning and design** Statement of Work, creation of formal requirements statement, architectural detailing, and creation of a detailed implementation project plan.
2. .decision[**Agree plan**]
3. **Implementation and go-live** Statement of Work, including development, integration, software testing, and User Acceptance Testing support, and post-go-live production warranty.
